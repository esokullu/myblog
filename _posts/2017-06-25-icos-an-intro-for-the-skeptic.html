<p>There’s been a lot of talk about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanchester/2017/06/12/a-new-way-to-raise-money-the-initial-coin-offering/#541edfd95fb5" target="_blank">ICOs</a> (initial coin offerings, named after IPO) in recent weeks, fueled by a number of companies you’ve never heard of raising ridiculous amounts of money. <a href="http://status.im/" target="_blank">Status</a>, reported to have raised <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/ico-blues-status-raises-58-million-leaves-buyers-waiting/" target="_blank">$64MM</a>; <a href="https://www.bancor.network/" target="_blank">Bancor</a>, another <a href="http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/06/17/bancor-ico-record-153million/" target="_blank">$153MM</a> -a record in ICO history-; and a company, at least I’ve heard once or twice before, <a href="https://www.kik.com/" target="_blank">Kik</a>’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/20/kik-ceo-claims-an-ico-is-better-than-venture-fundraising/" target="_blank">announcement</a> of an upcoming ICO at the Techcrunch event — all in one week.</p>
<p>According to the ICO aggregator <a href="https://www.smithandcrown.com" target="_blank">Smith-Crown</a>, more than $290MM has been spent in such token sale transactions over the past two years. Which cumulatively raise suggestions as to ICO may be the new VC.</p>
<p>Regardless these speculations, here you can find compiled a list of some of the most notable ICOs in the recent history. As you’ll see, many of them are fintech ventures, facilitating money transfer and exchange. Some are innovative platforms using blockchain in novel ways; such as file storage, organization management etc. Lastly, there is also a group of me-toos and shady applications; more so with ICOs than venture-capital or angel investing, because the backers can be hidden from the public eye.</p>
<p>CompanyDescriptionICO Funding<a href="http://tokencard.io" target="_blank">TokenCard</a>London based fintech venture. Provides a VISA debit card to pay for real-world transactions in ethers.<a href="http://www.the-blockchain.com/2017/05/04/monoliths-tokencard-massive-ico-minutes-raises-16-7-million/" target="_blank">$16.7MM</a><a href="http://humaniq.co" target="_blank">Humaniq</a>A fintech venture with a noble purpose; it provides a blockchain based mobile banking app for disadvantaged populations in Africa. A cheap ($20) mobile phone for Africa is also in the plans.<a href="https://blog.humaniq.co/well-done-humaniq-raised-5-1-mln-on-ico-4ea558b3517" target="_blank">$5.1MM</a><a href="https://golem.network" target="_blank">Golem</a>Uber for computers; creating a global market for computing cycles. Reminds me of Stanford’s <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Folding@Home</a> project, but built on blockchain, and reportedly, can help anyone benefit from the excess CPU inventory.<a href="http://impactcee.com/2016/11/17/golem-uber-computers-raised-8-6-million-just-half-hour/" target="_blank">$8.6MM</a><a href="https://aragon.one/" target="_blank">Aragon</a>Lets you create organizations,issue and trade shares electronically on the blockhain.<br>The blockchain notary method is self-governing, so in some sense, it works like a digital jurisdiction. I find this to be quite interesting, and in line with <a href="http://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>’s original goals.<a href="https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/ethereum-based-aragon-raises-25-million-15-minutes-record-ico/" target="_blank">$25MM</a><a href="https://openledger.info/" target="_blank">OpenLedger</a>A Denmark based blockchain holding company. Owns several blockchain applications, and continues to produce new ones. It looks like a “let’s throw ideas against the wall and let’s see what sticks” type of play.<a href="https://blog.openledger.info/2017/06/09/denmark-based-openledger-inks-deal-with-chinese-company-raising-11-million-dkk/" target="_blank">$1.65MM</a><a href="https://augur.net/" target="_blank">Augur</a>A prediction markets application built on top of blockchain. In a nutshell, it uses wisdom of crowd to forecast events. It’s hard to see how they will make a dent when traditional prediction markets have failed to make it big.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augur_%28software%29" target="_blank">$5.2MM</a><a href="https://www.xaurum.org/" target="_blank">Xaurum</a>Gold backed cryptocurrency.
