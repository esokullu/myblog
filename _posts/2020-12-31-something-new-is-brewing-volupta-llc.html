<p>Society is broken. Period.</p>
<p>If the hysteria and polarization in the media, loud and angry voices on Twitter, extreme leaders worldwide prove anything, it is that the very fabric of the society has come to a point where it is about to break.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.principles.com/the-changing-world-order/" target="_blank">Ray Dalio</a>, the last time we were here was just before World War I.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Dilemma" target="_blank">many believe</a>, is the insanity fueled by social media. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, and others amplify the extreme voices with their algorithms, for more eyeballs at the expense of our overall well-being.</p>
<p>Volupta LLC is here to bring sanity to our social relationships and fix the world. If you think this is a bold statement, that’ because it is.</p>

<p>The road ahead is rocky and long. We will begin by focusing on “families” and improving their well-being. Then we will launch more products to create new families and meaningful bonds.</p>
<p>Volupta LLC is in stealth mode for now, but you can already subscribe to this blog for more updates. We may be rambling from time to time on morals and society, but we will also use this space to share more about our story, roadmap, product launches, etc.</p>
<p>Onward and upward. Happy 2021 everyone!</p>
