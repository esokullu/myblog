<p>If you’re a startup owner, you know what I’m talking about. Every now and then, you’ll get an invitation from, or an introduction to the founders of your competitors. Or you’ll be the one asking for it.</p>
<p>I always thought it was a good idea and a noble thing to meet your competitors, chat, compare notes and remain friendly.</p>
<p>Although, in retrospect, I now realize, it is a delicate situation that one should be handling carefully. Because like it or not, business is business, competitors are competitors, and the feedback you’re getting will most probably be misleading.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if you don’t take the meeting, that’s another issue. See the Elon Musk vs Tim Cook drama. It rarely ends up with a positive outcome, you may end up being the one screwed because you were the one who dismissed the big opportunity.</p>
