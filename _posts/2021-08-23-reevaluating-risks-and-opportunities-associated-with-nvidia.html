<p>Those who follow this blog for a while would know how big of a $NVDA fan I happen to be. That said, Nvidia represents some new risks and opportunities since I last covered the company;</p>
<h3>Opportunities</h3>
<ul>
<li>At 75x PE ratio, the company is still not too expensive. Similar growth stories are known to be valued at 100x and even higher.</li>
<li>The latest <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2020/10/11/what-is-a-data-processing-unit-dpu-and-why-is-nvidia-betting-on-it/?sh=2e4e162c6a2d" target="_blank">DPU</a> announcement. Nvidia is marketing its <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion" target="_blank">Mellanox</a> (networked GPU) acquisition as DPU. Good marketing play.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/08/21/jensen-huang-interview-the-physical-world-and-the-metaverse-can-be-connected/" target="_blank">metaverse</a> buzz. Nvidia’s GPUs are at the forefront of an omniverse future.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ARM deal may not close. China is against it. And now the UK joined the band too in protectionist concerns.</li>
<li>Netflix announced gaming cloud which will rival Nvidia’s</li>
<li>Intel is getting serious about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/intel-provides-more-details-on-its-arc-gpus-which-will-be-made-by-tsmc/" target="_blank">GPUs</a>
</li>
<li>The PE ratio of Intel at 11x and AMD at 35x are way cheaper. Intel just <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005117/en/Intel-Wins-US-Government-Project-to-Develop-Leading-Edge-Foundry-Ecosystem" target="_blank">won</a> a US government deal, and AMD, under Lisa Su leadership, is pretty competitive.</li>
</ul>
