<p><br><em>NOTE: this is not investment advice</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Dating apps like Bumble (which also owns Badoo, very popular in Slavic countries) and Match Group (the company behind Tinder, OkCupid, PlentyOfFish) are going strong.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I believe dating apps have a lot more to offer. Bumble is doing really well, and according to their latest querterly call in February, AI technology is going to make these apps even better or a bit more tricky.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The tricky part comes from fake profiles. The dating apps that can spot and remove these fakes will be the most successful.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But AI also makes things better because it can look at how people talk to each other and help find better matches without needing to ask so many questions. It's like having a smart matchmaker.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Overall, I'm feeling good about where dating apps are headed. Even though the stock market is down because of interest rates, I think there's a good chance for dating apps to do well. Just remember, I'm not giving investment advice. But one thing is clear: AI is going to change dating in big ways.</p>
