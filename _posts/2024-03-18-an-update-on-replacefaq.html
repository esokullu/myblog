<p>In early 2023, I launched ReplaceFAQ, inspired by the unexpected popularity of a hobby project—a chatbot that mimicked Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, crafted from his public speeches, which resonated widely within my LinkedIn network. ReplaceFAQ was a Software as a Service (SaaS) initiative designed to transform ubiquitous FAQ sections on websites into interactive chatbots, leveraging Language Learning Model (LLM) technology, particularly through OpenAI APIs.</p>

<p>The concept quickly gained traction, securing a significant partnership with EnUygun, a prominent customer. While the opportunity was ripe for aggressive expansion and building out a dedicated sales team, I opted for a more measured approach. My priority was to ensure the success of our project with EnUygun, underscoring a commitment to quality and impactful results over rapid growth.</p>

<p>This phase of the venture lasted six months, during which OpenAI introduced its own finetuning APIs. This development added a layer of complexity to an already competitive market, prompting me to reevaluate the project's trajectory. I decided to put ReplaceFAQ on hold—a decision influenced by a strategic assessment of the evolving landscape. This period was immensely rewarding for me, and it highlights the importance of adaptability and the risks of overcommitment.</p>

<p>As ReplaceFAQ concluded, I consider that period of my career as a consultancy role with Wingie, EnUygun's parent company. As I turn my focus to the next wave of opportunities in the tech landscape, , I look forward to exploring  new advancements in blockchain and AI.</p>
