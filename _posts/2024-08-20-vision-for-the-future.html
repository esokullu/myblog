<p>Before industrialization, physical labor was the driving force of economies. The most valuable jobs were those that required muscle—farmers, builders, craftsmen—pretty much anyone who could produce tangible goods was vital to society.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With the advent of industrialization, however, muscle became a commodity. The focus shifted to brainpower. The valuable jobs became those that required intellect: marketing, sales, scientific research, and management. These fields shaped the modern economy and defined success in the industrial age.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But now, with the rise of artificial intelligence, even brainpower is becoming a commodity. AI is taking over roles that once required human intellect—drivers, analysts, customer service, and even creative work are being automated at an unprecedented pace.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Future Post-AI</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, what will be the most valuable skills in a post-AI world? Some argue that entrepreneurship will rise to the forefront because it requires a blend of creativity, risk-taking, and execution. While execution is indeed critical, it may not hold the unparalleled value many imagine.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I believe we are entering a new era altogether. Before diving into what this era entails, let's consider some of the expected changes:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Usuals</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>
<strong>Diminishing Nation-States:</strong> The concept of nation-states will weaken, giving way to a world where faith and ideology hold more sway than geographical borders.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>
<strong>Increased Privatization:</strong> We'll see more privatization of traditionally state-controlled services, from policing to military functions, even judicial systems. Corporations will take on roles once reserved for governments.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>
<strong>Evolving Identity:</strong> Traditional passports may disappear, replaced by digital identities—something akin to what Sam Altman is attempting with Worldcoin and similar initiatives. These digital IDs will be universally recognized, making borders less relevant.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>
<strong>The Future of Money:</strong> Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have already shown us a glimpse of the future of money—decentralized, borderless, and controlled by the people rather than governments.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Faith Tribes: The New Social Order</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On this shifting foundation, the new dominant social structure will be <strong>Faith Tribes</strong>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Faith Tribes will be communities built around shared beliefs and values, transcending traditional national identities. These tribes will determine how people live, who they marry, and what they believe. Our current social model is failing—people are increasingly unhappy, isolated, and disconnected. Faith Tribes will offer a sense of belonging and purpose.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>
<strong>Cosmetics and Virtual Realities:</strong> In this new era, physical appearance will become more important than ever. Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) will permeate every aspect of life, transforming the physical world into something resembling a Facebook feed, where personal data is as visible as your face. As a result, the line between the real and the virtual will blur, and people will invest heavily in their online personas. Jobs gaining momentum will include those in cosmetics, aesthetic surgery, and anything related to tourism and leisure. Just as the shift in wealth created LVMH over a 25-year period, we will see companies in these sectors thrive as the new era unfolds.</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>
<strong>The Rise of Hedonism:</strong> The pursuit of pleasure will become a dominant theme, with platforms like Bumble, Instagram, or their evolutions serving as the main tools for this lifestyle. We are likely to see an increase in hedonism as people seek instant gratification in an increasingly automated world where work is minimal and leisure is abundant. </li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list-item --></p>
<li>
<strong>Religious Practices:</strong> On the other hand, there will be a resurgence of traditional religious practices, but within these Faith Tribes, with rituals such as sacrifice, fasting, meditation, and marriage becoming more common and taking on different shapes and forms. People will seek meaning in rituals and ceremonies that connect them to something greater than themselves. <br>
</li>
<p><!-- /wp:list-item -->
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Search for Armageddon?</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In a world where there is little left to do, where most tasks are automated, and people have more time than they know what to do with, there may be a subconscious drive toward conflict—a search for purpose in destruction. This could manifest in global tensions, such as the ongoing conflicts involving Iran and Israel. A reduction in population might even be seen as necessary by some, a way to restore balance, reduce pollution, and mitigate climate change in an increasingly overcrowded world.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Faith Tribes are not just a social phenomenon; they are a response to the changes that AI and technological advancement will bring. As we enter this new era, the way we define ourselves, our work, and our communities will undergo a radical transformation. The old world is fading, and a new one is being born—a world where faith and values reign supreme, and where the virtual and real are indistinguishably intertwined.</p>
