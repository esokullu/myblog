<p>In a world where generating new cartoons or movies in the style of The Simpsons, Pixar, Quentin Tarantino, or Christopher Nolan becomes incredibly inexpensive thanks to Generative AI (GenAI), the creation of new genres and styles may become obsolete. The reason is that the cost of developing these new styles will be prohibitively high. While the masses will be able to quickly generate innovative ideas, making a new style widely popular will be a significant challenge due to its expense.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For instance, consider The Simpsons. It was developed over decades, resulting in a vast amount of training data that allows for the generation of new episodes from simple story texts. With this foundation, producing a new Simpsons episode becomes relatively straightforward. In contrast, creating new cartoon styles will be akin to crafting hand-made Ferrarisâ€”luxurious but prohibitively expensive. Not just for a one-time creation, but repeatedly so.</p>

<p>This shift indicates a move towards "stability," as I discussed in my previous "Vision for the Future" article. I foresee the future becoming more stable, reminiscent of pre-industrial times when people focused more on family and spirituality than on continuous work and conflict. Our current capitalist-driven creativity has led us away from these values, and while it has not necessarily improved our quality of life, advancements in AI and technology may offer a chance to embrace a more fulfilling and extended existence. Ultimately, we may return to a lifestyle that values meaningful engagement over constant innovation, finding contentment in faith and community, a.k.a Faith Tribes.</p>
